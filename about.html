            Snakes in Exile, founded in  1992, has a repertoire of Celtic trad and original material
            topped up with an  occasional well-chosen cover. This is not your regular 'folkband'.
            They have  their own sound based mainly upon their vocal harmonies and a lively ambience.
        </p>
        <p>
            This specific Snakes sound  was recorded on four albums so far. 'Songs and Salads' was released under direct management in 1996  and 'Second Skin' was born at the end of 1998. The third CD, 'Merrily  Polluted' was presented in May 2002.
            In september 2007, to celebrate their 15th anniversary,  they released ‘Time flies when you’re having fun’. It’s the band’s first  live-album featuring 16 tracks that have been favourites in their concerts over  these 15 years but had to wait for a live recording before getting on a CD.
            Some work of the band can  also be found on a growing number of compilation albums.

            While Snakes in Exile still  loves to play in smokey pubs, there has been a change of scenery
            to bigger  occasions. Some highlights?
            The clubtent at the prestigious Cambridge Folk  Festival and the Ely folk festival (UK).
            Rock Affligem, annual  appearances at the Scottish weekend in Alden Biezen
            and the big Dranouter  folkfestival in Belgium.
            The band has been invited for interviews and live performances by several shows  on national radio. Snakes songs are broadcasted by radio stations in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Canada and Alaska.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The band 's name 'Snakes in  Exile' was inspired by the legend of St. Patrick. It is said that the holy man  banished all vermin whilst christianising Ireland. Apparently, so far, no  snakes have been spotted on the island...<br>
            Originally a trio, Snakes  in Exile became a quartet in 2000 with the addition of drummer Gette De Deken. In 2006, he handed over his  drumsticks to Kristiaan Malisse.<br>
